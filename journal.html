<h1 style="color:limegreen;">First Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 9/20/23- We're doing HTML and have put our websites on the internet. We've made buttons and learned how to color them. We've dabbled into fonts, and I've put images into the website. I have made 2 mach-ups for my website, the both involve a minigame but for now it'll just be some buttons but won't actually do anything special. We just used terminal for the first time, and it's more intuitive that I would think. I'm very happy with my progress so far!
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Second Journal Entry: How and why you push to Github</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;">
Step 1: Open terminal<br>
Step 2: cd ./desktop<br>
Step 3: cd ./ gcender13.github.io<br>
Step 4: git add .<br>
Step 5: git commit -m "message"<br>
Step 6: git push<br>
Notes: ls will list the options going down. Once you are in your folder, git status will let you see what isn't updated. <br>
This updates your website to github. Once this happens, it is saved to the internet. You need to do this a lot, so get used to it.
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Website Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 10/11/23- We've finished a functional draft of our websites! They have specific aesthetics and reflect ourselves, and have links to a journal page, a projects page, and an about page!
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Clicking Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 11/5/23- It's been a while since I journaled, but here's an update! For a while, we made jumpscares for halloween, and were introduced to a Javascript section, where you can make your divs and do things when interacted with by users, besides just hrefs. We've just been introduced to click counters, which track how many times something has been clicked so it can have multiple functions.
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Javascript Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 11/14/23- More Javascript! I recently figured out how to use strings to make urls, make functions create interactive divs, and use if-thens (sometimes with elses). I've started on a project that's a compilation of the boys, where in the center there will be a rotation of pictures that change when clicked, and on the sides there will be videos of them. Cacio will be on the top and Pepe will be on the bottom. I'm excited to see how this will turn out!
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Cats Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 11/21/23- Finished with the cat compilation! Learned how to use videos and had my first major set of bugs that needed to be fixed! Bug fixing here is much harder than Scratch, because in Scratch it's generally something contradicting itself but here a single character can confuse the whole program (my problem was an extra closing curly bracket, why that's a massive problem I don't know). Cute project in the end though!
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Random Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 1/9/24- Back from break and it's the new year! Using the math function more now, learned how to make a random number generator that can choose something from a set of choices called an array! I'm trying to use it to make a random name generator, I'll see how it goes!
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Array Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 1/23/24- The array project is done! I'm still working on making it look nice, but the functionality is there. It has kinda turned into a fantasy word generator just from looking at the results, but that's fine. I'm about to start working on finishing my index page and touching up my website, and at some point I might actually do the about page? Still unsure on that one. 
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Index Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 2/1/24- Done with the index page, I had the idea for animations since I started the year and it was good to finally make them. Really wasn't too bad to actually make either, just needed a hand from Molly a couple times. It's set up so you click a place, the cat walks there and lies down before you can click it again and it'll actually link you to the connected page. Just did a thing where you can press  the arrow keys to make a div move, still don't know where that's going to go though.
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Game and Color Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 2/22/24-Currently trying to do a couple things now, there's a galaga type game that's been pretty difficult. Moving the projectiles is hard and I'm unsure how to make smooth movement, but doing some pixel art has been pretty fun. Outside of that, I'm learning how to use RGB, another way to make color. I'm not sure what I want to do with it, a color guessing game could be cool but I also want to find some way to make it unique.
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Game and Color Entry 2</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 2/27/24-I've figured out what to do for the color guessing game. I want to use a  system where the colors become more and more opaque as time goes on, but because that means as time goes on it will get easier to guess, more points will be rewarded for guessing the color quickly. The ship game I want to put on hold until I finish the color game, as it's proven quite hard to make. I'm confident I can get it done, it'll just take time.
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Project Ideas</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 3/7/24-Just some ideas to make/ in the future:
Fine-tune homepage<br>
Galaga game<br>
Color-opacity game<br>
Study social media algorithms<br>
2048<br>
Tower Defence Game<br>
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Final Project</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 4/11/24-Back from Spring Break, and now we're going to start doing our projects. I'm trying to make a galaga type game, and it's going pretty well for how difficult parts of it seemed. The first step was movement which is pretty easy but its weird and jerky without a special system. I first made one, then reworked and simplified it to be less complicated but have less weirdness and work with diagonal movement. Making the ship's lasers move properly was also pretty difficult, but I have a functional system now. Up next is enemies and figuring out how to track collision with the lasers, which I think is the most difficult thing I've done so far. Hopefully it goes well though!
