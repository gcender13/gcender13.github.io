<h1 style="color:limegreen;">First Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 9/20/23- We're doing HTML and have put our websites on the internet. We've made buttons and learned how to color them. We've dabbled into fonts, and I've put images into the website. I have made 2 mach-ups for my website, the both involve a minigame but for now it'll just be some buttons but won't actually do anything special. We just used terminal for the first time, and it's more intuitive that I would think. I'm very happy with my progress so far!
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Second Journal Entry: How and why you push to Github</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;">
Step 1: Open terminal<br>
Step 2: cd ./desktop<br>
Step 3: cd ./ gcender13.github.io<br>
Step 4: git add .<br>
Step 5: git commit -m "message"<br>
Step 6: git push<br>
Notes: ls will list the options going down. Once you are in your folder, git status will let you see what isn't updated. <br>
This updates your website to github. Once this happens, it is saved to the internet. You need to do this a lot, so get used to it.
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Website Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 10/11/23- We've finished a functional draft of our websites! They have specific aesthetics and reflect ourselves, and have links to a journal page, a projects page, and an about page!
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Website Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 11/5/23- It's been a while since I journaled, but here's an update! For a while, we made jumpscares for halloween, and were introduced to a Javascript section, where you can make your divs and do things when interacted with by users, besides just hrefs. We've just been introduced to click counters, which track how many times something has been clicked so it can have multiple functions.
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Website Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 11/14/23- More Javascript! I recently figured out how to use strings to make urls, make functions create interactive divs, and use if-thens (sometimes with elses). I've started on a project that's a compilation of the boys, where in the center there will be a rotation of pictures that change when clicked, and on the sides there will be videos of them. Cacio will be on the top and Pepe will be on the bottom. I'm excited to see how this will turn out!
</p>
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Website Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 11/21/23- Finished with the cat compilation! Learned how to use videos and had my first major set of bugs that needed to be fixed! Bug fixing here is much harder than Scratch, because in Scratch it's generally something contradicting itself but here a single character can confuse the whole program (my problem was an extra closing curly bracket, why that's a massive problem I don't know). Cute project in the end though!
<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Website Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 1/9/24- Back from break and it's the new year! Using the math function more now, learned how to make a random number generator that can choose something from a set of choices called an array! I'm trying to use it to make a random name generator, I'll see how it goes!
