<h1 style="color:limegreen;">First Journal Entry</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;"> 9/20/23- We're doing HTML and have put our websites on the internet. We've made buttons and learned how to color them. We've dabbled into fonts, and I've put images into the website. I have made 2 mach-ups for my website, the both involve a minigame but for now it'll just be some buttons but won't actually do anything special. We just used terminal for the first time, and it's more intuitive that I would think. I'm very happy with my progress so far!

<h1 style="color:limegreen;">Second Journal Entry: How and why you push to Github</h1>
<p style="color:limegreen;">
Step 1: Open terminal<br>
Step 2: cd ./desktop<br>
Step 3: cd ./ gcender13.github.io<br>
Step 4: git add .<br>
Step 5: git commit -m "message"<br>
Step 6: git push<br>
Notes: ls will list the options going down. Once you are in your folder, git status will let you see what isn't updated. <br>
This updates your website to github. Once this happens, it is saved to the internet. You need to do this a lot, so get used to it.
