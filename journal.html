<h1>First Journal Entry</h1>
<p> 9/20/23- We're doing HTML and have put our websites on the internet. We've made buttons and learned how to color them. We've dabbled into fonts, and I've put images into the website. I have made 2 mach-ups for my website, the both involve a minigame but for now it'll just be some buttons but won't actually do anything special. We just used terminal for the first time, and it's more intuitive that I would think. I'm very happy with my progress so far!
